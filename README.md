# ccd_calibration_pipeline
This project implements a fully automated CCD image calibration pipeline written in Python, using the astropy and ccdproc libraries. Its purpose is to build master calibration frames (BIAS, DARK, FLAT) and apply them to science frames (“LIGHT”) according to standard astronomical data reduction procedures.
